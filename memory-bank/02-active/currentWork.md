# Current Work: mem-sqlite Recent Files Integration (Completed with Caveats)

**Status**: ✅ Feature complete, ⚠️ Requires daemon setup

**Branch**: `feature/mem-sqlite-recent-files`

## This Session's Work

**Completed: mem-sqlite Recent Files Integration (editor-hook-16)**

Successfully integrated mem-sqlite database querying into the FZF command palette, adding a "Recent Files" option that shows the last 25 files Claude touched across all sessions.

### What We Built

**Core Feature:**
- New "Recent Files" menu option in Pattern 2 FZF palette
- Queries mem-sqlite database for tool_uses (Read/Edit/Write operations)
- FZF picker with full-height layout and batcat syntax-highlighted preview
- Graceful error handling when database is missing

**Technical Implementation:**
- SQL query using `json_extract()` to parse tool parameters
- Bash wrapper script: `lib/scripts/query-recent-files.sh`
- Symlink-aware path resolution (handles `~/.local/bin/claude-editor-hook` → actual location)
- FZF layout: 100% height, preview on top (up:70%)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `lib/scripts/query-recent-files.sh` (new) - SQL query wrapper
- `bin/claude-editor-hook` (lines 44-51, 78-110) - Symlink resolution + Recent Files handler
- `memory-bank/01-architecture/systemPatterns.md` - Architecture documentation
- `README.md` - Feature documentation

### Beads Issues Closed (8 total)

- ✅ editor-hook-17 (P0): Setup mem-sqlite dependencies and run initial sync
- ✅ editor-hook-18 (P1): Design and test SQL query for recent files
- ✅ editor-hook-19 (P1): Create query wrapper script
- ✅ editor-hook-20 (P1): Add Recent Files option to Pattern 2 FZF menu
- ✅ editor-hook-21 (P2): File action submenu (deferred - direct open works well)
- ✅ editor-hook-22 (P2): Error handling for missing database
- ✅ editor-hook-23 (P2): Testing with real data
- ✅ editor-hook-16 (P2): Parent issue

**Average lead time**: 0.5 hours

### Current Issue: Stale Database (editor-hook-25, P0)

**Problem:**
Recent Files shows files from psyt-finance-dash (worked on weeks ago) instead of current claude-editor-hook session files.

**Root Cause:**
The database is **correct but stale**. mem-sqlite was synced once at 7:19:31. At that moment, psyt-finance-dash files were genuinely the most recent. Current session started after sync, so its tool_uses aren't in the database yet.

**Evidence:**
```
Database newest timestamp: 2025-10-30 07:19:31
Current time: 2025-10-30 07:27:42 (8 minutes later)
Current session tool_uses: NOT IN DATABASE
```

The query is working correctly - it's showing the most recent data available. The data is just outdated.

**Solution:**
This is a **deployment/setup issue**, not a code bug. mem-sqlite needs to run as a continuous daemon:

```bash
cd ~/code/mem-sqlite && npm run cli start
```

This keeps the database current with sub-second latency.

**Scope:**
Out of scope for current feature branch. Needs:
1. Documentation in README about daemon requirement
2. Possibly: systemd service or background startup script
3. Possibly: Auto-sync fallback if daemon not running
4. Possibly: Visual indicator of database staleness in menu

See **editor-hook-25** for detailed analysis and solution options.

## SQL Query Design (Working Correctly)

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  json_extract(tu.parameters, '$.file_path') AS file_path,
  MAX(tu.created) AS last_touched
FROM tool_uses tu
WHERE
  tu.toolName IN ('Read', 'Edit', 'Write')
  AND json_extract(tu.parameters, '$.file_path') IS NOT NULL
  AND json_extract(tu.parameters, '$.file_path') != ''
GROUP BY file_path
ORDER BY last_touched DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

**Query validates correctly:**
- Extracts `file_path` from JSON `parameters` field using SQLite's `json_extract()`
- Filters to file operation tools (Read/Edit/Write have `file_path` parameter)
- Deduplicates with `DISTINCT` + `GROUP BY`
- Orders by `MAX(created)` to get most recent touch per file
- Limits to 25 for manageable FZF menu

**Tested against real database with 48,501 tool uses - performs well.**

## Architecture: Pattern 2 FZF Command Palette

Pattern 2 now includes 8 menu options:
1. Edit with Emacs
2. Edit with Vi
3. Edit with Nano
4. Open Terminal (with `$PROMPT` env var)
5. **Recent Files** (mem-sqlite query) ← NEW
6. Detach (exit to Claude Code)
7. Enhance (Interactive) - spawn parallel Claude instance
8. Enhance (Non-interactive) - auto-enhancement with Haiku

**Layout:** Full-height FZF (100%), clean and responsive.

## What's Next

### Immediate (P0)
1. **editor-hook-25**: Resolve stale database issue
   - Document daemon requirement in README
   - Consider auto-sync fallback
   - Add staleness indicator?

### Then (P1)
1. **editor-hook-15**: Explore template abstraction (minimal informational vs directive)
2. **editor-hook-2**: Implement persistent "Claude" session (simple approach)

### Future (P2)
1. **editor-hook-24**: Documentation update (blocked by editor-hook-25)
2. Context file reading - Parse `~/.claude/editor-context.yaml`
3. MCP tool for context writing

## Key Learnings

**Symlink Resolution:**
Using `BASH_SOURCE[0]` and iteratively following symlinks is critical when script is installed via symlink to `~/.local/bin/`.

**FZF Preview Layouts:**
- `--preview-window=right:60%` - Side-by-side (good for wide terminals)
- `--preview-window=up:70%:wrap` - Stacked (better for narrow terminals, more vertical space)

**mem-sqlite Architecture:**
- ETL pipeline: JSONL → SQLite transformation
- Real-time sync requires daemon, not one-shot
- Database size grows linearly with conversation history (310MB for moderate usage)
- Query performance excellent even with 48K+ rows

**Orchestrated Subagent Workflow:**
Planning agent → Granular Beads issues → Execution. Highly effective for well-defined features.
