# Current Work: Directive-Based Enhancement System

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Date**: 2025-11-02

## This Session's Focus

**Directive System for Prompt Enhancement (Completed)**

Replaced the old `*** marker ***` pattern with an explicit hashtag directive system that gives users clear control over enhancement types.

**What We Shipped:**
- ✅ Directive system: #enhance, #spellcheck, #suggest, #investigate, #fix, #please
- ✅ Updated `lib/scripts/create-subagent-context-lite.sh` - System and user prompts
- ✅ Updated README.md and public Reddit post with directive examples
- ✅ Deprecated Pattern 9 (old standalone enhancement)
- ✅ Updated all documentation to reflect new directive capabilities
- ✅ Token-efficient design: context files read on-demand by Haiku

**Previous Session: Streaming Output Enhancement (Oct 31)**
- ✅ Created `lib/scripts/stream-claude-output.sh` - NDJSON parser with visual formatting
- ✅ Updated `menu-core.sh` to use `--output-format stream-json`
- ✅ Added colored icons for different tool types
- ✅ Real-time progress display with completion summary

**Previous Session: Memory Bank Refresh (Oct 31)**
- ✅ Archived three completed sessions to `04-history/sessions/2025-10/`
- ✅ Refreshed `00-core/projectbrief.md` - Now describes working command palette
- ✅ Rewrote `01-architecture/systemPatterns.md` - Documents current architecture
- ✅ Archived `command-palette-paradigm.md` - Original vision now historical reference
- ✅ Updated `02-active/` files - Blockers, currentWork, nextUp

## Current Project State (Oct 2025)

**What's Working:**
- ✅ FZF command palette with 8 options
- ✅ Persistent "Claude" tmux session
- ✅ Unified menu system (lib/menu-core.sh)
- ✅ JSONL-based Recent Files with caching
- ✅ Subagent context packages (conversation + tools + files)
- ✅ Terminal workspace with `$PROMPT` env var
- ✅ Interactive and non-interactive enhancement agents

**Recent Completions:**
- **Oct 31**: Streaming output for non-interactive enhancement (real-time progress)
- **Oct 31**: Memory bank refresh (documentation cleanup)
- **Oct 30**: JSONL migration (eliminated mem-sqlite dependency)
- **Oct 30**: Menu unification (single source of truth)
- **Oct 30**: Context packages (rich parent context for subagents)
- **Oct 29**: Session persistence (simple "Claude" session pattern)
- **Oct 29**: Recent Files integration

## Architecture Snapshot

**Entry Point:** `bin/claude-editor-hook` (Pattern 2)
**Core Logic:** `lib/menu-core.sh` (unified menu)
**Helper Scripts:**
- `query-recent-files-jsonl.sh` - JSONL parser with caching
- `create-subagent-context.sh` - Context package generation
- `extract-parent-context.sh` - Conversation history extraction
- `stream-claude-output.sh` - Stream-json parser with visual output (NEW)

**Key Patterns:**
1. **Ctrl-G Interception** - Hook `$EDITOR` to show FZF menu
2. **Session Persistence** - Always use tmux session named "Claude"
3. **JSONL Parsing** - Direct log parsing with intelligent caching
4. **Context Packages** - Auto-generated parent context for subagents
5. **File-based IPC** - Parallel instances communicate via prompt file
6. **Directive System** - Hashtag-based enhancement control (#enhance, #spellcheck, etc.)

## Theoretical Exploration: Multi-Agent Orchestration

**Document:** `memory-bank/01-architecture/multi-agent-orchestration-exploration.md`

**Status:** Purely speculative thought experiment, not actively planned

**Idea:** Transform persistent "Claude" session into a multi-agent runtime with orchestrated specialized agents (Planning, Coding, Testing) coordinated by a Chief of Staff pattern.

**Reality Check:** Likely more complexity than value. Current manual spawning via command palette works well. The orchestration overhead (coordinator process, agent lifecycle tracking, status synchronization, error handling) probably isn't justified by usage patterns.

**Decision:** Not pursuing unless clear pain points emerge from real usage that this would solve.

## Recent Commits (Last Week)

```
53dcb19 feat: Enhance Recent Files with path truncation and view/edit choice
95cfb08 Merge feature/unify-menu-system: Unified menu with shared core
6dead6b feat: Add subagent context package system with rich parent context
a954dce feat: Replace mem-sqlite with JSONL-based Recent Files
66e76c4 feat: Add session persistence to Pattern 2 (editor-hook-2)
```

## What's Next

**Immediate:**
1. ✅ Memory bank refresh complete
2. Use the tool in real sessions, note what's useful vs what's not

**Short-term:**
1. Test working features against real usage patterns
2. Identify pain points or missing capabilities
3. Consider extensions to menu (git ops, log streaming, etc.)

**Future Possibilities (Not Actively Planned):**
- YAML context system (if multi-file use cases emerge)
- MCP integration for context writing
- Browser DevTools integration
- Multi-agent orchestration (interesting theory, probably overkill)

## Key Learnings (Recent Sessions)

**JSONL Parsing > mem-sqlite:**
- Direct parsing eliminates daemon dependency
- Caching provides better performance
- Simpler architecture, fewer moving parts
- Always current (reads actual logs)

**Unified Menu System:**
- Single source of truth prevents divergence
- Easy to extend with new options
- Consistent behavior across entry points

**Simple Session Persistence:**
- Always "Claude" session beats project-based hashing
- Clean, understandable model
- User can create additional windows

**Context Packages:**
- File-based IPC avoids shell escaping complexity
- Rich context (conversation + tools + files) makes subagents genuinely useful
- Auto-generation on spawn keeps it frictionless

## Session Stats

**Memory Bank Update:**
- Files created: 3 (archived sessions)
- Files modified: 3 (projectbrief, systemPatterns, currentWork)
- Files moved: 1 (command-palette-paradigm → history)
- Documentation lines: ~800 written

**Note:** Memory bank now accurately reflects working implementation vs aspirational vision. Future updates should maintain this accuracy.
