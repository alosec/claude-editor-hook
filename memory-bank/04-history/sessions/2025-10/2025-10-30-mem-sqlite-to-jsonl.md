# Session: mem-sqlite to JSONL Migration (2025-10-30)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## What We Shipped

Replaced mem-sqlite database dependency with direct JSONL log parsing for Recent Files feature, eliminating the need for external daemon and improving performance with intelligent caching.

## The Problem

Initial implementation used mem-sqlite to query Claude Code's conversation history:
- Required separate daemon (`npm run cli start`)
- Database could become stale if daemon not running
- Additional dependency to manage
- 310MB database size for moderate usage

## The Solution

**Direct JSONL Parsing:**
- Read Claude Code's native JSONL session logs from `~/.claude/projects/`
- Parse Read/Edit/Write tool invocations with `jq`
- Intelligent caching system for performance
- Zero external dependencies

**Performance Results:**
- First run: ~1s (parses last 5000 lines from each JSONL file)
- Subsequent runs: <100ms (cached until JSONL files change)
- Cache location: `lib/cache/recent-files-*.json`

## Files Changed

**Created:**
- `lib/scripts/query-recent-files-jsonl.sh` - JSONL parser with caching logic

**Modified:**
- `lib/menu-core.sh` - Updated Recent Files menu to use JSONL parser
- `README.md` - Documented new JSONL-based approach

**Deleted:**
- `lib/scripts/query-recent-files.sh` - mem-sqlite version (kept for reference)

## Implementation Details

**JSONL Parsing Strategy:**
```bash
# Find project directory mapping
PROJECT_DIR=~/.claude/projects/-project-name/

# Parse tool invocations from JSONL
jq -r 'select(.type == "tool_use") |
       select(.name == "Read" or .name == "Edit" or .name == "Write") |
       .input.file_path' calls/*.jsonl

# Group by file path, keep most recent timestamp
# Cache results with JSONL file modification times as cache key
```

**Cache Invalidation:**
- Compares cached JSONL mtimes against current mtimes
- Regenerates cache only when source files change
- Per-project cache files prevent cross-contamination

## Key Learnings

**Why Direct JSONL Parsing Won:**
1. **No daemon management** - Works out of the box
2. **Always current** - Reads actual session logs
3. **Simpler architecture** - Fewer moving parts
4. **Better performance** - Caching eliminates repeated parsing

**Trade-offs:**
- Parsing JSONL is slightly slower than SQL on first run
- Caching solved this completely
- Net result: faster, simpler, more reliable
